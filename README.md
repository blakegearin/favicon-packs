# Favicon Packs

This is a [browser extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension) to apply icon packs as [favicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon).

## Features

- [x] Choose from 4,900+ icons (Ionicons, Font Awesome, Lucide)
- [x] Easily add domains or patterns for more advanced matching
- [x] Custom colors for light & dark themes
- [x] Guards against favicon hijacking (e.g. Notion)
- [x] Convenient copy to clipboard buttons help keep track of values
- [x] Selectable rows allow for bulk updates
- [x] Create catch-alls or categories using the priority ordering
- [x] Upload images as a backup option

## FAQ

- Why these icons?

  - I made this to recreate the easy favicon swapping of a discontinued browser that used Ionicons. Others were added for convenience.

- Can my favorite icon pack be added? <small>_(last updated: March 2025)_</small>

  - Bootstrap
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/twbs/icons/pull/2114).
  - Iconoir
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/iconoir-icons/iconoir/issues/398).
  - Remix Icon
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon/pull/979).
  - Heroicons
    - Not right now. It's pretty small.
  - Boxicons
    - Not right now. It's missing support for sprites and tags.
  - Material Symbols
    - No. It's a smaller, marketed toward enterprise, and made by a megacorporation that may deprecate it at any time.
  - Something else
    - Generally speaking, it needs to have a public CDN to fetch all icons in bulk (sprite or symbols or SVGs). The same goes for tags which enable search. CSS or font-based solutions are not compatible.
    - Uploading your own files is always an option!
