## FAQ

- Why these icons?

  - I made this to recreate the easy favicon swapping of a discontinued browser that used Ionicons. Others were added for convenience.

- Can my favorite icon pack be added? <small>_(last updated: March 2025)_</small>

  - Bootstrap
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/twbs/icons/pull/2114).
  - Iconoir
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/iconoir-icons/iconoir/issues/398).
  - Remix Icon
    - Not right now. It may be possible [in the future](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon/pull/979).
  - Heroicons
    - Not right now. It's pretty small.
  - Boxicons
    - Not right now. It's missing support for sprites and tags.
  - Material Symbols
    - No. It is smaller, marketed toward enterprise, and made by a mega-corporation that may deprecate it at any time.
  - Something else
    - Generally speaking, it needs to have a public CDN to fetch all icons in bulk (sprite or symbols or SVGs). The same goes for tags which enable search. CSS or font-based solutions are not compatible.
    - Uploading your own files is always an option!

- What about Chromium browsers?

  - I don't have plans to port this due to Google's manifest v3 rollout. It's harmful and anti-competitive. I recommend reading [this article from EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening). I'm a big fan of [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) at the moment.
